Hello,

this is a repository to practice my use of node.js.

These modules follow he principle of K.I.S.S.(Keep It Simple Stupid) and are all very easy to understand.

Also b4-hand i appologize for node fs... i couldnt get it to cooperate with me in what i wanted the terminal to say;
i resorted to just writing a new file and removing it if it exists.

Hope you enjoy.
